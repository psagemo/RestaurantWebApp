# RestaurantWebApp

Welcome to this Restaurant Web App featuring the fictional Restaurant Ribeira!

This website was built using ASP.NET MVC Identity and uses role-based authorization to separate the admin user from the regular user

The website is built with two different types of users in mind.

Firstly this site is built with the customer/regular user in mind. The site enables the customer to read about the restaurant, view the restaurant's current menu and, by createing an account, making table reservations. Assuming the customer has made one or more reservations, the customer can view and manage reservations made from the same account.

This site also targets the restaurant manager and/or staff using the admin role. With the admin role, the staff are allowed to manage the menu by adding new menu items and editing or deleting existing menu items. They are also allowed to view, edit and delete all reservations made by users as well as adding new reservations.
